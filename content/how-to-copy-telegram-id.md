Copying your **Telegram user ID** is simple with @print_id_bot. Here is how to do it safely.

## Step 1: Get your ID

1. Open [@print_id_bot](https://t.me/print_id_bot) in Telegram.
2. Tap **Start**.
3. The bot replies with your **User ID** and **Chat ID** (they match in private chat).

## Step 2: Copy

- **Mobile:** Tap and hold the number, then choose **Copy**.
- **Desktop:** Select the number and copy (Ctrl+C / Cmd+C).

Telegram formats the ID in a `<code>` block, so tapping it often copies the number. The bot also says "Tap the number to copy."

## Step 3: Share safely

- **Only with trusted services** — Bots and apps can message you if they have your ID. Share only with services you trust.
- **Do not post publicly** — Avoid sharing your ID in public groups or forums. It can lead to spam or abuse.
- **No payment for ID lookup** — Legitimate ways to get your ID are free. Avoid services that charge or ask for payment.

## What not to do

- **Do not share with "ID lookup" services** — Services that claim to find IDs by phone number are often scams. You cannot get someone else's ID that way. See [Telegram ID vs username](/telegram-id-vs-username/).
- **Do not assume ID is secret** — Bots can read it when you interact. Treat it like a semi-private identifier.

## Getting the ID again

Open @print_id_bot and send any message or `/id`. The bot replies with your IDs. The response language follows your Telegram setting (16 languages supported, fallback to English).

## FAQ

### Is it safe to give my ID to a bot?
It depends on the bot. Trusted bots (e.g. for notifications or integrations) need it to message you. Avoid unknown or suspicious bots.

### Can someone spam me if they have my ID?
Bots can send you messages if they have your ID and you have not blocked them. Only share with services you trust.

### How do I copy a group chat_id?
Add @print_id_bot to the group, send /id or mention it, and tap the chat_id number to copy. See [add a bot to a group](/add-bot-to-group-chat-id/).

### Does the ID change?
No. Your Telegram user ID is permanent. You can copy and reuse it.

### What if the copy does not work?
Try selecting the number manually. On some clients, the code block may need a long-press or double-tap to copy.
